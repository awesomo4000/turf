## Architecture

Turf uses a layered architecture:

- **Native Layer** (Zig): Window management and application lifecycle
- **Bridge Layer** (Objective-C): Platform-specific WebKit integration
- **Web Layer** (JavaScript/HTML): User interface and application logic

Communication between layers uses JSON message passing, allowing for clean separation of concerns.
